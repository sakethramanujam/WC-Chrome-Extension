A simple java script based word count extension for Google Chrome. :bowtie:

### :bulb: What is WC-Chrome Extension? 

###### WC stands for ***Word Counter***.

- This an  extension which I though would be useful for me while preparing for my language proficiency test where in we have to keep track of number of words used.
- It is quite common in various applications that we have to fill in say x number of words and in many cases there's no word counting software not available on such applications. So I decided to make an extension where in I could paste my text and know the no. of words.
